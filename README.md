# TOHacks 2018: A Python Website
Welcome to our repo! This contains a beginner's trials on building a website using Python.

Our team consists of four excellent members: Japvinit, Jisu, Charley, Vincent.

We do not know what we are doing, with the exception of Charley, so please be forewarned if things break and we don't understand why they're breaking.
